###ENTRYPOINT


it is also working as CMD insruction ( its excuites at the time of container creation).




difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we can't override the "ENTRYPOINT", but we can override the "CMD" instruction.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if we try to override the ENTRYPOINT instruction, it will append on the ENTRYPOINT command only.
