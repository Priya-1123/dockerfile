this is my first docker file.

Dockerfile - Dockerfile is a text file.
 it is a declarative way of our own images.

docker image - image is an static file.
we can create N number of containers in one image.
it consists of 
                            image = base os + software installation + package installation.

docker container - it is running instance of image.
it is mini virtual machine(server).
